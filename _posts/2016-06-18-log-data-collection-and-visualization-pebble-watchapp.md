### Introduction
Log transforms your Pebble into a powerful data collection tool that's ready to capture information wherever you go.  Whether you want to track smartstrap output (e.g. GPS or heart rate), built-in sensor data (compass, accelerometer), or your own custom-defined events and properties, Log allows you to collect the data that's important to you, and easily visualize the results. :watch: :arrow_right: :bar_chart:  

### Open Beta
The [initial `0.1` release of Log](https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/5766525e3feaee4aa3000192) is limited to two example tracking events that allow users to manually track charging habits/battery life (`Charged Pebble` and `Unplugged`); at present all user data is aggregated, and may be viewed via app settings in the Pebble Android/iOS app. :iphone: :mag_right: :bar_chart:  

### Next Steps

Once the underlying functionality has been validated, the ability to collect and analyize smartstrap, health, voice, and other custom data will be incorporated. :bowtie:
